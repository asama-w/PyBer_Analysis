# Analysis of PyBer's Rideshare Data
## 1) Analysis Overview
### 1.1) Purpose of the Analysis
This analysis is carried out via python to see the relationships between the ride-share fare and the three city types during a 4-month period, for PyBer company, which is a python-based ride-sharing app company. It aims to create a visualization to show the total weekly fares for each city type, and discover the trends between the data, in order to assist PyBer in making business decisions regarding the differences between the ride-sharing data among these city types.

### 1.2) Overview of the Project
This analysis will be creating the followings;
+ The **summary data frame** of ride-sharing data by city types consisting of their statistical outputs and calculations.
+ The **data visualization as a line chart** of the total weekly fare of the three city types during 4 months, January to April, 2019.

The locations of the complete code used for this analysis and the visualization saved as a figure are as follow;
+ **Code**: `PyBer_Challenge.ipynb`
+ **Result Visualization's Figure**: `analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png`

### 1.3) Resources
